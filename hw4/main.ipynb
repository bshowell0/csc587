    "### Why did the success rate improve?\n",
    "\n",
    "The success rate improved significantly for two main reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **More Training Steps:** The slippery environment is stochastic, meaning the same action in the same state can lead to different next states. A small number of training steps (like 2,000) is insufficient for the agent to experience the full range of possible outcomes for each state-action pair. By increasing the training steps to 200,000, the agent gathers a much larger and more representative sample of transitions. This allows the Q-values to converge more closely to their true expected values, which properly account for the environment's randomness.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Slower Epsilon Decay:** The decay rate for epsilon was reduced from 0.0001 to 0.00001. A slower decay means that the `epsilon` value stays higher for longer, forcing the agent to perform more random (exploratory) actions throughout the extended training period. In a stochastic environment, thorough exploration is critical to avoid settling on a suboptimal policy that might seem good based on early, lucky outcomes. The prolonged exploration ensures the agent discovers more robust paths to the goal that are less susceptible to the environment's slipperiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the combination of significantly more experience and a more patient exploration strategy allowed the agent to build a much more accurate and robust model of the stochastic environment, leading to a higher success rate."

    "### Why did the performance drop so drastically in Experiment 2?\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance plummeted in the second experiment due to two interconnected factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Premature Exploitation:** The `decay_rate` was increased from `0.00001` to `0.001`. This causes the exploration probability, `epsilon`, to decrease very rapidly. The agent stops taking random actions and starts exploiting its learned knowledge far too early. Since it has only been trained for a few episodes, its \"knowledge\" is based on a tiny, unrepresentative sample of the environment. It likely latches onto a poor, short-sighted strategy and never explores enough to find the better, long-term solution required to balance the pole for 200+ steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Insufficient Training Data:** Training for only 100 episodes is not enough time for the neural network to learn the complex dynamics of the CartPole environment. In the early stages, episodes are very short as the agent's policy is essentially random. With only 100 short episodes, the total number of (state, action, reward) samples collected is extremely small. The Q-network cannot generalize from such sparse data and fails to learn a meaningful policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, the second experiment combines the worst of both worlds: it forces the agent to commit to a strategy before it has had a chance to explore (due to rapid epsilon decay) and it doesn't provide enough experience for any strategy it learns to be a good one (due to the low number of episodes). The first experiment succeeded because the long training duration and slow decay rate allowed for a healthy balance between exploration and exploitation, which is crucial for effective reinforcement learning."
