- change of scope
  - Instead of customizing a fully personalized local assistant, which I now don't want to do because sourcing the data for that (a bunch of facts about myself) would be hard, I think I will train it on basic facts about myself pertaining to interview and related stuff. For me this is basic interview things about myself, and code projects that I've written.
  - Basic facts include but not limited to:
    - name
    - goal
    - school
    - work experience
    - common interview questions
  - My code includes:
    - My github repos
