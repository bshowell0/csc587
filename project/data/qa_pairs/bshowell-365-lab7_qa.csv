"What is the main purpose of the `bshowell0-365-lab7` repository?","This repository contains a Python-based command-line application that serves as a front-end for a hotel reservation system. It allows users to interact with a MySQL database to view rooms, make and cancel reservations, search for bookings, and view revenue reports."
"How are the project's dependencies and configuration managed?","The project uses `python-dotenv` to manage configuration. Database credentials (user, password, host, name) are stored in a `.env` file, which is created by renaming and modifying the provided `.env.example` file. Key Python libraries include `mysql-connector-python` for database interaction and `pandas` for data display."
"Describe the overall architecture of the application.","The application is structured around a central controller, `main.py`, which handles the main application loop and database connection. The core logic is modularized within the `src` directory, separating concerns into `printer.py` for user interface and console output, `request.py` for executing SQL queries and business logic, and `validate.py` for handling all user input validation."
"How does the application display data to the user?","The application uses the `pandas` library to display data in a clean, tabular format. The `src/printer.py` module is responsible for taking the results of database queries, creating a pandas DataFrame, and printing it to the console. It also configures pandas to fit the output to the terminal's width for better readability."
"What is the function of the `main.py` script?","`main.py` is the entry point and main controller of the application. It establishes the connection to the MySQL database, then enters a loop that prompts the user for a command. Based on the user's input, it calls the appropriate functions from the `src/validate.py` and `src/request.py` modules to execute the requested feature. It closes the database connection when the user quits."
"What functionalities are available to the user in this hotel reservation system?","The system offers five main functionalities: FR1 (Rooms and Rates) to view room details and popularity, FR2 (Reservations) to book a room, FR3 (Reservation Cancellation) to cancel a booking, FR4 (Detailed Reservation Information) to search for existing reservations, and FR5 (Revenue) to generate a monthly revenue report."
"How does the 'Rooms and Rates' (FR1) feature calculate a room's popularity?","The popularity score is calculated using a SQL query with a Common Table Expression (CTE) found in `src/request.py`. It determines the score based on the proportion of the last 180 days that the room has been occupied, calculated as `ROUND(COUNT(DATEDIFF(CheckIn, Checkout))/180, 2)`."
"What happens if a user tries to make a reservation (FR2) for a room that isn't available on their chosen dates?","The system has a sophisticated fallback mechanism. If no exact match is found, the `fr2_res_empty` function in `src/request.py` is triggered. It runs multiple queries to find and suggest alternatives, such as different available dates for the same room, different rooms available on the original dates, or available 'gaps' between other reservations. The top 5 alternatives are presented to the user."
"How does the system calculate the total cost for a new reservation?","The total cost is calculated within the `fr2_res` function in `src/printer.py`. It iterates through each day of the proposed stay, determines if it's a weekday or a weekend, and applies a 10% surcharge (multiplying the base price by 1.1) for weekend nights."
"How does a user cancel a reservation (FR3)?","A user can cancel a reservation by selecting the 'Reservation Cancellation' option and providing their unique reservation code. The system first fetches and displays the reservation details for confirmation. If the user confirms, the application executes a `DELETE` SQL statement to remove the corresponding record from the `lab7_reservations` table."
"What search capabilities does the 'Detailed Reservation Information' (FR4) feature provide?","The FR4 feature provides a powerful and flexible search tool. Users can search for reservations using any combination of first name, last name, room code, reservation number, or a specific date/date range. The underlying SQL query, built dynamically in `src/request.py`, supports SQL wildcards like `%` and `_` for partial string matching."
"How does the application generate the annual revenue report (FR5)?","The revenue report generation is handled primarily in Python using the `pandas` library, as seen in the `fr5` function in `src/printer.py`. It fetches all reservations for the current year, then 'explodes' each reservation into a series of daily records. Finally, it uses `pandas.pivot_table` to aggregate the daily revenue for each room by month, creating a summary table with both monthly and yearly totals."
"What is the role of the `src/validate.py` module?","`src/validate.py` is responsible for ensuring the robustness of the application by validating all user input. It checks that menu selections are valid, that names are alphabetical, that numbers are digits, and, most importantly, that dates are in the correct 'YYYY-MM-DD' format and logically consistent (e.g., start date is before end date)."
"How does the application's user interface enhance readability?","The UI, managed by `src/printer.py`, uses several techniques for readability. It clears the console screen (`\033[H\033[J`) before displaying new information, uses ANSI escape codes to underline key parts of the menu options (`\033[4m`), and leverages the `pandas` library to format data into well-aligned tables."
"How does the reservation search feature (FR4) handle date range queries?","When a user provides a date range (e.g., '2023-10-01 to 2023-10-10'), the `fr4_req` function in `src/validate.py` parses it into two separate dates. The SQL query in `src/request.py` then finds reservations that overlap with this period using the condition `res.CheckIn <= end_date AND res.Checkout > start_date`."
"What is the purpose of the `src/__init__.py` file?","The `src/__init__.py` file explicitly defines the public API of the `src` package by setting the `__all__` variable to `['printer', 'request', 'validate']`. This makes it clear which modules are intended to be imported and used by other parts of the application, such as `main.py`."
"How does the application handle database transactions when a new reservation is created?","The `mysql.connector` connection object (`conn`) is passed from `main.py` to the `request.fr2` function. If the user successfully selects a room and the `INSERT` query in `fr2_res_update` is successful, control returns to `main.py` which then calls `conn.commit()`. This ensures that the new reservation record is only permanently saved to the database upon successful completion of the entire booking workflow."
"What is the role of the `.env.example` file?","The `.env.example` file serves as a template for the required configuration. A user must rename it to `.env` and fill in their specific database credentials (`DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_NAME`) for the application to connect to the MySQL database."
"How does the application interpret flexible user commands, such as 'res' for making a reservation?","The application uses a set of validation functions in `src/validate.py`. For example, `validate.fr2(usr)` checks if the user's input string is 'fr2', 'reservations', or 'res'. The `if/elif` block in `main.py` uses these functions to determine which feature the user wants to access, providing a more user-friendly experience."
"What are the three distinct strategies the application uses to find alternative reservations if a user's initial request (FR2) can't be met?","When an exact match for a reservation isn't found, the `fr2_res_empty` function in `src/request.py` executes three queries to find alternatives: 1. It finds the next available time slot for the desired room type and stay length. 2. It finds other rooms that are available during the user's originally requested date range. 3. It searches for 'gaps' between existing bookings that are long enough to fit the user's stay."
"Explain the data transformation process used to create the revenue report in FR5.","The `fr5` function in `src/printer.py` uses the pandas library for this transformation. It first gets a list of all reservations for the year. It then uses `df.apply` to create a date range for each reservation and `df.explode` to transform each single reservation row into multiple rows, one for each day of the stay. This 'exploded' data allows `pandas.pivot_table` to easily sum the daily revenue by room and month."
"How is the database connection managed for efficiency?","The application establishes a single, persistent database connection and cursor in `main.py` when it starts. These connection objects are then passed as arguments to the various functions in `src/request.py` as needed. This is more efficient than opening and closing a new connection for every single query."
"What information is shown to a user when they ask to cancel a reservation (FR3)?","Before the cancellation is final, the system retrieves the reservation details from the database. It then displays this information—including the reservation code, room, check-in/out dates, rate, and guest name—to the user in a pandas DataFrame and asks for a 'Yes/No' confirmation to prevent accidental cancellations."
"What specific validation checks are performed on the dates provided by a user when making a reservation?","The `fr2_req` function in `src/validate.py` performs several checks. It uses a regular expression to ensure the date matches the `YYYY-MM-DD` format. It checks that the date is a real, valid calendar date. It ensures the date is in the future (not in the past). Finally, it verifies that the check-in date is before the check-out date."
"How does the `fr4_req` function in `src/validate.py` support flexible searching with wildcards?","The `fr4_req` function includes a helper function `wildcard()` that checks if a string contains only valid characters for its type (e.g., alphabetic characters plus '%' or '_' for a name search). This allows users to input partial names or codes with SQL wildcards, which are then used directly in the `LIKE` clause of the SQL query in `src/request.py`."
"What is the purpose of the `pandas.concat` call in the `fr2_res_empty` function?","The `fr2_res_empty` function executes three separate SQL queries to find different types of reservation alternatives. Each result is loaded into a separate pandas DataFrame. `pandas.concat` is then used to merge these three DataFrames into a single, comprehensive list of all possible suggestions, which is then presented to the user."
